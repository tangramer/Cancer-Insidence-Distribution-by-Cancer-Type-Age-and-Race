# Cancer-Incidence-Distribution-by-Cancer-Type-Age-and-Race
# introduction
In this assignment, we attempt to visualize the distribution of the incidence of cancer among different cancer types, ages and races of people. The initial motivation for this visualization lies in the difference in prognosis of cancer across the world. For example, breast cancer patients in asian countries tend to have longer life expectancy than that in US and Europe. There might be genetic or environmental impacts for people in different regions. To unpack the influence of genetic factors, visualizing cancer morbidity among different races of people would be of great beneifit. As human genetic expression is different across different ages, we decide to look at the incidence distribution among different ages. To clearly show the change or trend of such distribution, bar graph would be the best choice. To avoid overwhelming readers with too many bars for results of different races of people, we decide to use a button for race change and assign different colors for different races. We also use redundant texts to further indicate the race of people that the readers are currently looking at. We use a transition of 500ms to guide readers a sense of change in the distribution of certain cancer as race of people changes. To unravel more genetic effect accross the whole body, we generate 4 buttons to show the distribution of 4 different cancer types, namely breast cancer, brain cancer, lung cancer and melanoma. These four cancer types are representative of different parts of body. 
# Developemnt process:
We spent 2 days discussing the best idea to visualize and then spent another one day to finalize the techiques we need for the visualization. We spent another 3 days to learn d3.js under the guidance of the demo page. As we haven't used d3.js before, we are mostly contrained within the techniques that the demo demonstrated. Roughly we spent 30h on this visualization and it has been equally distributed among two of us in the team. Finalizing the idea and learning visualization techniques are the most time-consuming part.
